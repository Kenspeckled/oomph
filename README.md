## Work In Progress
This project has changed significantly since conception and is headed towards a new major release that will turn it from a ORM to a full framework. Sit tight, still a lot of work to do!

Object Oriented javascript models for the client and the server.

## Add a little oomph to your project 

```
npm install --save oomph
```

## Scope
This project aims to provide a Object Oriented Javascript application framework that attempts to find as much unity as possible between serverside and clientside code. The aim is to decrease duplication of effort as well as code by:
  * building views that can be rendered by both server and client
  * constructing server and client models with common interfaces so client and server can share actions
  * generating (configurable) RESTful APIs for every model
  * providing named routes and a single set of route configurations

## To Do
* Full framework file structure implemented
* Better conceptual framework for "Actions"
* Tests
* Models defined once - not duplicated
* File Generators
